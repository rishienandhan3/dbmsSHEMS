# Smart Home Energy Management System (SHEMS) 
Designed and developed a module for a Smart Home Energy Management System (SHEMS) focusing on storing and managing past energy usage data, enabling users to comprehend their energy consumption and costs related to various appliances and settings.

Implemented user account management features, allowing customers to sign up, add multiple service locations with detailed information, and enroll smart devices such as AC, dryer, lights, and refrigerator, capturing essential data like model number, type, and events.

Developed a robust data storage system for SHEMS, handling diverse types of information sent by enrolled devices, including events (switching on/off, setting changes) and energy consumption data, ensuring accurate recording with device ID, time stamp, event label, and corresponding values.

Integrated functionality to capture and store dynamic energy prices, considering hourly variations and location-dependent fluctuations based on zip codes, enhancing the system's capability to calculate energy costs accurately over time.

Created web-based UI with measures to guard against SQL injection, cross-site scripting attacks and concurrent access, allowing users to optimize their energy consumption using impactful data summaries and visualization.
